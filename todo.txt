Must: 
1. resultInventory to be populated for quarter -1 for each team when creating game. for +-50% of prev quarter.permissible X and Y for -1 should be 0 so that in quarter 0 all fresh will got to market and no spot buying.

'' if last qtr is not there than permissible shall be blank and treated as zero therefore all fresh purshase go to market or Vendor .. but if it has permis x of last quarter than limit market/vendor purchase up to +-50 and buy remaining from spot. this +-50 will go to this qtr permissible.
>> permissible X means fresh purchases only from market/vendor in current quarter.
freshPurX means fresh purchases required from Market/Vendor and Spot

==>>  previous quarter permissible X and Y
Effect: Rawmaterial Purchase cost for current Quarter can not be calculated.

2. adding or manipulating columns of  dtRawMaterialCost may affect wrong results in all types of inventory. So be cautius.

3. by default teams supplier is vendorID 0 from vendorMarket of businesstype. after empannelment supplier changes. Whenever adding new business also add vendorid 0 data.(Add new business module to be created for vendorMarket and productmaster)

Also if vendorId in vendorMaster is supplying any particular product then replicate other product cost from vendorID 0 ie market rates. (Logic to e developed during vendor creation- Whenever market rate of 0 changes in subsequent quarter.. also update same rates in nonzero vendor id.)


Rules:
1. cash collection due shall be recievable in next quarter.

2. Tender qty awarded to be supplied in current quarter will only be displayed and cash collection will be done for these quantities in current quarter.

## Tenders###
3. By default System will try to supply Tender qty from inventory. If not able to meet then outsource it to resultMarket.
If team has given production priority in resultTenders then reduce it from total production to get available stock for sales.
set 1 fro production priority and 0 for not so that multipliucation will give a zero. Reduction in total production will result
in market share allocation.subtract the priority quantities of tender for each products. If production is less than tender to be supplied then market allocation for that product shall be zero.
4. raw Material and spot raw material purchase will be done from resultMarket.

5. Once subscribe, Subscription charges shall be levied each quarter till unsubscribe.

6. If i have empanneled vendor than spot rate will not be applied for Raw as well as Products.
ConsumX is consumption of Raw material for production, OpeningX is closing inventory from last quarter, decisionX is
decision sheet value of raw material, lastwtdavgConX is last wtd avg price of total consumption(For qtr 0 it may be actual market rate as qtr -1 be blank).
CostX and spotCostX is either open market cost or empanneled VendorCost, lastpermissibleX is permissibleX ie fresh purchases made on market/vendor (and not spot) in last qtr.
lastQtrPercent is to be applied on lastpermissibleX  to get permissibleX of this quarter to purchase from market/vendor (and not spot). spotX is to be purchased on spot rates thus 
freshPurX is sum of  permissibleX  and spotX. Xvalue is cost of permissibleX and spotXvalue is cost of spotX.
freshXvalue is sum of Xvalue and spotXvalue . wtdAvgPurX is freshXvalue / freshPurX . 
while wtdAvgConX is (openingXvalue+freshXvalue)/(OpeningQty+FreshQty) and this will go to get unit cost of product.
